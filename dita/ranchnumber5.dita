The thing that sticks out to me about this ranch, and not in a good way, is the flavor. There is something artificial lurking beneath the creamy surface of this ranch dressing, and I do not enjoy it. I am not convinced that this ranch isn't squeezed out of a bottle of Kraft and then served. The flavor just doesn't offer wow factor, and the texture is a little too gloppy for my liking.</p><p class="- topic/p "><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Blacksburg Tavern: Not as bad as Easy Squeeze...</title><image href="blacksburgtavern.jpg" class="- topic/image "/></fig></p><p class="- topic/p ">While I still wouldn't call this Hidden Valley Easy Squeeze quality ranch, I also would never dream of comparing it to Ken's Buttermilk. I definitely recommend the food here, but I recommend ordering something that you don't want to dip in ranch. Or just going in aware and okay with the fact that you're about to eat the fifth best ranch in Blacksburg when the best is just up the street.</p></body></topic>

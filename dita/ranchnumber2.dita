The consistency is 100% there, just the right amount runny to combat the creaminess. The flavor is almost perfect - but there's just a little bit lacking when compared to Ken's Buttermilk Ranch. Maybe they need to add more dill. I'm not completely sure what flavor is missing in the puny little cup of ranch that Sharkey's provides for dipping, but I am sure that it's missing something.</p><p class="- topic/p "><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Sharkey's Wing &amp; Rib Joint: A close second!</title><image href="sharkeyslogo.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Image of Sharkey's logo: Where Good Friends Go!</alt></image></fig></p><p class="- topic/p ">All in all, Sharkey's offers a good ranch for a casual french fry. Like PK's, the portion size is just way too small, and though I've never asked for extra at Sharkey's, I'm sure they would charge me for it. Unlike PK's, the flavor is not quite a Ken's Buttermilk replica. Don't get me wrong, though, this is definitely no Hidden Valley Easy Squeeze Ranch. Sharkey's ranch is the second best in Blacksburg!</p></body></topic>

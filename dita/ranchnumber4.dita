I guess Bull &amp; Bones is technically a Brewhaus, though, which makes sense because their ranch is just not fantastic. The consistency is fine, but the flavor is lacking and the portions are small. I don't have any specific qualms with this ranch, it just doesn't amaze me.</p><p class="- topic/p "><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">Bull &amp; Bones: Not the best, not the worst</title><image href="bullandbones.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Image of the outside of Bull &amp; Bones Brewhaus</alt></image></fig></p><p class="- topic/p ">The menu at this restaurant implies a fantastic ranch, and it does not offer a fantastic ranch. It does offer a good ranch, though. If you are normal and enjoy ranch regardless of it being perfect on my scale, head on down to Bull &amp; Bones Brewhaus  to enjoy the fourth best ranch in Blacksburg.</p></body></topic>

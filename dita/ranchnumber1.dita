Extremely close if not identical to Ken's Buttermilk.</shortdesc><body class="- topic/body "><p class="- topic/p ">PK's Bar and Grill easily has the best ranch in Blacksburg. There is a perfect amount of dill &amp; tang in the flavor and a great consistency - not too thick and not too runny. My only complaint about this ranch is that it comes in an extremely small side dipping container. I need more!! </p><p class="- topic/p "><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">PK's Bar &amp; Grill: Home of the most fantastic ranch in Blacksburg</title><image href="pksbarandgrill.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Image of the outside of PK's Bar &amp; Grill</alt></image></fig></p><p class="- topic/p ">Despite the portion size not meeting my liking, this ranch wins by a landslide when compared to the other ranches offered in Blacksburg. PK's ranch is nowhere near Hidden Valley Easy Squeeze, it's in a league of its own. Move over, Ken's Buttermilk, there's a new ranch in town.</p></body></topic>

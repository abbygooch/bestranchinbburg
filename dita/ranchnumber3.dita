The flavor is solid, all of the right spices, but the consistency kind of makes you feel like you're eating ranch from a veggie tray at a child's birthday party. I wouldn't call it sour cream consistency, but I definitely wouldn't call it Ken's Buttermilk Ranch either. I will say, however, that The Cellar serves ranch in a considerably larger dipping cup that it's competition.</p><p class="- topic/p "><fig class="- topic/fig "><title class="- topic/title ">The Cellar: Decent ranch, but not the best...</title><image href="thecellar.jpg" class="- topic/image "><alt class="- topic/alt ">Image of the outside of The Cellar Restaurant</alt></image></fig></p><p class="- topic/p ">The consistency alone keeps The Cellar's ranch from rising any higher  than the third best in Blacksburg. I am sure this ranch is fairly easy to squeeze... The Cellar should be thankful that the place that sells them their dipping sauce cups makes them big, because that's the only thing that kept them in the top three. </p></body></topic>
